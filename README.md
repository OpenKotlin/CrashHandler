# CrashHandler

## What is CrashHandler?

CrashHandler is a simply util to handle android application crash, people who want handle application crash can use this util easily and also this util is uncoupled with their own code.

## How I use it?

- Add this repo to your project

- Install CrashHandler into your Application like below:

  ```java
  class DemoApplication : Application(), CrashListener {
  
      override fun onCreate() {
          super.onCreate()
          //Register CrashHandler when application is created
          CrashHandler.of(this).install(this)
      }
  
      override fun onCrash(t: Throwable?, activity: Activity): Boolean {
          //TODO Do what you want at here(Upload crash log, recover your activity...)
          return false
      }
  }
  ```
